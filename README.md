IEEE CyberSecurity Workshop Registration System

Description:
=
The IEEE CyberSecurity Workshop Registration System is a web-based application designed to facilitate registration for a cybersecurity workshop organized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in Cairo. The system allows interested participants to register for the workshop by providing their personal information through an online form. The collected data is stored securely in a database for further processing.

Key Features:
=
1-User Registration: Participants can register for the cybersecurity workshop by providing their full name, username, email address, password, phone number, address, and birthdate through a registration form.
2-Form Validation: The registration form includes client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly before submission. Additionally, server-side validation is performed using PHP to check for duplicate usernames or email addresses and to verify that the passwords entered by the user match.
3-Database Integration: The application integrates with a MySQL database to store user registration data securely. Data is sanitized using mysqli_real_escape_string() function in PHP to prevent SQL injection attacks before being inserted into the database.
4-Feedback to Users: Users receive immediate feedback through alert messages indicating the success or failure of their registration attempt. Alert messages are displayed in different colors to distinguish between success, error, and warning messages.
5-Security Enhancements: Implement additional security measures, such as HTTPS encryption, input validation, and data encryption, to protect user data and prevent security vulnerabilities.
